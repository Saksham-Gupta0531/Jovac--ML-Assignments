1. What are the key assumptions underlying linear regression?
Linear regression relies on several fundamental assumptions for valid results:

Linearity: The relationship between predictors and the outcome should be linear.
Independence: Observations must be independent, with no correlation among residuals.
Homoscedasticity: The variance of errors should remain constant across all levels of the independent variables.
Normality of errors: Residuals should be normally distributed.

2. In which scenarios is logistic regression preferred over linear regression?
Logistic regression is ideal when:

The target variable is categorical, not continuous.
The task involves classification into discrete groups.
The relationship between predictors and the outcome is non-linear, following a sigmoid curve.

3. How should you interpret coefficients in logistic regression?
In logistic regression:
Coefficients indicate the change in log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit increase in a predictor, holding others constant.
Positive values increase the likelihood of the positive class; negative values decrease it.
The effect is non-linear due to the sigmoid transformation, and depends on the values of all predictors.

4. What distinguishes the sigmoid function from the softmax function?
Sigmoid: Used for binary classification, it maps inputs to probabilities between 0 and 1.
Softmax: Used for multiclass classification, it transforms a vector of values into a probability distribution summing to 1.
Application: Sigmoid is for two-class problems; softmax is for problems with more than two categories.

5. Why is R-squared not an appropriate metric for logistic regression?
R-squared measures explained variance in continuous outcomes, but logistic regression predicts categorical outcomes.
Logistic regression outputs probabilities, not continuous values, making R-squared calculations unsuitable.
The concept of "variance explained" does not translate meaningfully to classification tasks.
